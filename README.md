# Walmart Sales ðŸ›’ DashBoard 

The business problem for making this template was that walmart had to fetch on insights on how they can optimize their sales strategy and maximize their profitability.The dashboard allows to track key performance indicators such as sales revenue, units sold, and profit margins across different Walmart locationsÂ andÂ products.

Recently I got opportunity to attend a very productive masterclass conducted by Rakshit Vig sir and so good to know he was amongst the alumni of my university . Got to learn so much about data analytics trends, all pros about the field and motivating us to explore in it.
Major take aways from this session:
- use of Power BI efficiently and hands on training on it
- Python and SQL for data visualization purpose
- Networking bonuses
Following is the dashboard on sale analytics of Walmart made duringÂ theÂ session.
